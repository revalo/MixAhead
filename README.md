## Usage

The usage is pretty restricted as of now, but fire up FL Studio (64-bit) only and then launch the application. Select an ASIO output source in the application and then insert a track in FL Studio. Select a section and wait for the overlay to match the status bar. Now press `Ctrl + R` and then `Ctrl + V`. Press the enter key and choose to render the song selection in 16 bit wav.

The audio should now be playing through the ASIO output selected. You can now listen and mix in FL Studio and render a section again based on what you've mixed using the above procedure.

### Under Development

This project is under heavy development, with a lot of stability fixes and features planned.
